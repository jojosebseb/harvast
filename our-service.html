                <p>Harvast offers you a variety of solutions for your personal effects shipment. There are several options available to you if you are considering moving overseas: </p>
                <p>
                <b>1 . Sea Freight, Full container load.</b>
                <br>
                Your effects will be loaded into a metal container and sealed at your residence, before being delivered straight to the port. This direct service means transit times are shorter than shared or groupage options.
                This service is ideal if you are taking the majority of contents for a three bedroom property.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>2 . Sea Freight, Less container load (or groupage consignments)</b>
                <br>
                If you are taking less than a full house, Harvast offers space in a container, which is effectively shared with other shippers going to the same destination.
                This is a cost effective method of shipment but transit time is usually longer as there is a period of consolidation prior to departure.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>3 . Air Freight</b>
                <br>
                If you require your items to arrive quickly, airfreight could be the solution and offers a much faster transit time. For air shipment, your goods will be cased to ensure maximum protection during the transit. Airfreight is charged per kilogram and is usually more expensive than sea freight.

                <b>Residence Moving</b> - Moving to a new house can be a stressful experience. In fact, it takes good planning and
                preparation to make sure you get things right the first time every time. Each house moving project has its
                own unique requirements. Hiring the right moving provider is important to minimize your stress levels while
                ensuring that damage and losses to property during transport do not happen. Here at Harvast, we specialize
                in providing house moving services to make things easy for you as you move into your new home.
                </p>
                <p>
                We offer individually tailored packages designed to successfully pull off any kind of house moving project.
                Prep is done cleanly and efficiently with professional packing and disassembly of furniture and other home appliances.

                <p>
                <b>Office Moving</b> - To plan the move in accordance with the clientâ€™s needs, Harvast arranges a meeting to discuss and map out the exact details of your office move. This allows us to understand fully what you want us to do, and to apply the necessary resources and equipment. We can also assign a Project Manager to take care of your office move. Although a Project Manager is not always necessary, we would certainly suggest it with a larger scale office move. Our project managers have an in depth knowledge and experience of office removals, and will help you plan and organize your relocation more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                By ensuring relocation is completed on time and your office items are properly secured at all times, our goal is to keep hassle at a minimum.
